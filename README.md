## Project Description
The "Covid_vaccine-tweet-analytics-app" is a Streamlit web application that uses pre-trained models from Huggingface to classify the sentiment of tweets related to Covid-19 vaccines. The app allows users to enter a keyword or phrase related to Covid-19 vaccines and displays the sentiment analysis of the resulting tweets in real-time. The models used in the app include BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, which are state-of-the-art natural language processing models. The app also includes a visualization of the sentiment analysis results, allowing users to easily see the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral tweets related to Covid-19 vaccines.
